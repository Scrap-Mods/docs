## sm.storage

**Associated object type:** [Storage](/docs/game_script_env/userdata/Storage)

<strong>Storage</strong> is used for saving and loading any Lua data into the world's database. <br></br>
This allows for data to be retrieved after closing and reloading the world.

Storage can only be used on the [server](/docs/#server).

:::caution warning
Storage allows for data to be saved immediately into the world's database. <br></br>
This is a <strong>very slow</strong> process and should be done as sparsely as possible.

If you have data that is shared globally and updated often, consider using global variables instead. <br></br>
Ideally, storage should only be used to save data upon closing the world, or when saving a creation on the Lift.
