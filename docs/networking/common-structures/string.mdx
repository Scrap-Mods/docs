# String

The `String` structure is a simple utf-8 encoded string type that is used to represent text, prefixed with a size in bytes. It is commonly used in the network protocol to represent text data. This pattern of a size prefixed string is sometimes referred to as a "Pascal String".

## Structure

| Offset | Field Name | Field Type | Notes |
|--------|------------|------------|-------|
| 0x00   | Size       | be u16     | The size of the string in bytes. |
| 0x02   | Data       | char[Size] | The utf-8 encoded string data. |
