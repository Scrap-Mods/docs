## BlobData Payloads

In this subsection, known [BlobData](/docs/structures/networking/blobdata) payloads are listed. This is not guaranteed to be an exhaustive list.

- **World ID**: [No World](/docs/structures/networking/blobdata#special-world-ids)
- **Flags**: 20 (0b10100)

#### Payload

| Field Name | Field Type | Notes |
