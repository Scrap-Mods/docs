# Compound Packet

This packet combines multiple packets into a single packet, which is then sent over the network. The subpackets of this packet must not be compressed.

Can contain any Server -> Client packet that is documented with `LZ4 Compressed: Yes`, because internally the game handles non-compressable packets in a previous stage.

- **ID**: 0x1D (29)
- **Size**: Variable
- **LZ4 Compressed**: Yes
- **State**: Playing
- **Bound To**: Server -> Client
