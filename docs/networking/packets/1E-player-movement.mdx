title: Player Movement

This packet contains pressed movement keys and the player's look direction. It does not contain any position coordinates.

The client sends this packet to the server once every tick. If the client's framerate drops below the tickrate, at most one packet is sent per frame.

## Structure

| Offset | Field Name | Field Type  | Notes |
|--------|------------|------------ |-------|
| 0x00   | Unknown    | u8          | Always `0x80`. |
| 0x01   | Tick       | be u32      | The current tick. |
| 0x05   | Keys       | u8 bitfield | Bitfield of which movement keys are pressed. See [Keys bitfield](#keys-bitfield). |
| 0x06   | Direction  | u8 bitfield | Bitfield of the last horizontal direction moved in. See [Direction bitfield](#direction-bitfield). |
| 0x07   | Yaw        | u8          | The player's horizontal look rotation. A yaw of `0` means the player is looking into the positive Y direction. Rotating counter-clockwise (to the left) increases the yaw. After reaching `255`, the yaw overflows back to `0`. |
| 0x08   | Pitch      | u8          | The player's vertical look rotation. A pitch of `0` means the player is looking straight down (into the negative Z direction). Looking straight up yields a pitch of `128`. |

### Keys bitfield

Contains information about which movement keys are pressed. All bits are always low while the player's character is seated or tumbling.

                Always lags one tick behind when starting a sprint from standstill. The sprint bitflag also continues to stay high for one more tick after the player has stopped moving horizontally.

                <p>The direction relative to the player the player is walking in or has last walked in. When the player stops walking, this value is not updated.</p>
                Ranges from <code>0</code> up to and including <code>7</code>. Strafing right starts at <code>0</code> and increases by <code>1</code> for every 45 degrees rotated counter-clockwise (to the left). Bit <code>7</code> is the most significant bit.
