# Player Movement

This packet contains pressed movement keys and the player's look direction. It does not contain any position coordinates.

The client sends this packet to the server once every tick. If the client's framerate drops below the tickrate, at most one packet is sent per frame.

- **ID**: 0x1E (30)
- **Size**: 8 bytes
- **LZ4 Compressed**: Yes
- **State**: Playing
- **Bound To**: Client -> Server

## Structure

| Offset | Field Name | Field Type  | Notes |
|--------|------------|------------ |-------|
| 0x00   | Tick       | be u32      | The current tick. |
| 0x04   | Keys       | u8 bitfield | Bitfield of which movement keys are pressed. See [Keys bitfield](#keys-bitfield). |
| 0x05   | Direction  | u8 bitfield | Bitfield of the last horizontal direction moved in. See [Direction bitfield](#direction-bitfield). |
| 0x06   | Yaw        | u8          | The player's horizontal look rotation. A yaw of `0` means the player is looking into the positive Y direction. Rotating counter-clockwise (to the left) increases the yaw. After reaching `255`, the yaw overflows back to `0`. |
| 0x07   | Pitch      | u8          | The player's vertical look rotation. A pitch of `0` means the player is looking straight down (into the negative Z direction). Looking straight up yields a pitch of `128`. |

### Keys bitfield

Contains information about which movement keys are pressed. All bits are always low while the player's character is seated or tumbling.
