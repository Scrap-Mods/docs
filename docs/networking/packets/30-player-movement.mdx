# Player Movement

This packet contains pressed movement keys and the player's look direction. It does not contain any position coordinates.

The client sends this packet to the server once every tick. If the client's framerate drops below the tickrate, at most one packet is sent per frame.

- **ID**: 0x1E (30)
- **Size**: 8 bytes
- **LZ4 Compressed**: Yes
- **State**: Playing
- **Bound To**: Client -> Server

## Structure

| Offset | Field Name | Field Type  | Notes |
|--------|------------|------------ |-------|
| 0x00   | Tick       | be u32      | The current tick. |
| 0x04   | Keys       | u8 bitfield | Bitfield of which movement keys are pressed. See [Keys bitfield](#keys-bitfield). |
| 0x05   | Direction  | u8          | <p>The horizontal direction, relative to the player's yaw, the player is walking in or has last walked in. When the player stops walking, this value is not updated.</p> Strafing right starts at `0` and increases when changing the direction counter-clockwise (to the left). When using the keyboard, only distinct increments of `32` can be achieved, but the server supports any value between `0` and `255`. |
| 0x06   | Yaw        | u8          | The player's horizontal look rotation. A yaw of `0` means the player is looking into the positive Y direction. Rotating counter-clockwise (to the left) increases the yaw. After reaching `255`, the yaw overflows back to `0`. |
| 0x07   | Pitch      | u8          | The player's vertical look rotation. A pitch of `0` means the player is looking straight down (into the negative Z direction). Looking straight up yields a pitch of `128`. |

### Keys bitfield

Contains information about which movement keys are pressed. All bits are always low while the player's character is seated or tumbling.
