## Structure

| Offset | Field Name                | Field Type           | Notes |
|--------|---------------------------|----------------------|-------|
| 0x00   | Lift ID                   | be u32               | The ID of the lift to import the creation on. |
| 0x04   | Uncompressed Size         | be u32               | The size of the blueprint data before it is compressed with LZ4. |
| 0x08   | Compressed Size           | be u32               | The size of the blueprint data after it is compressed with LZ4. |
| 0x14   | Compressed Blueprint Data | LZ4 compressed bytes | The contents of the `blueprint.json` file, compressed with LZ4 block compression. |

:::info
The blueprint data can be decompressed using the `lz4_decompress_safe` function from the LZ4 [C API](https://github.com/lz4/lz4). The `lz4.block.decompress` function from [python-lz4](https://github.com/python-lz4/python-lz4) can also be used by providing the `uncompressed_size` argument. Without this argument, decompressing the blueprint data will fail.
:::

:::note
When compressing the blueprint data, ensure the used LZ4 library does not prepend the `Compressed Blueprint Data` field with the compressed size.
