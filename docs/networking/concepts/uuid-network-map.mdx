# UUID Network Map

To reduce the amount of bytes sent over the network, the game maps UUIDs of shapes and joints to shorter 16-bit indices. This is done by creating a network map that maps UUIDs to indices and vice versa. The network map is never sent over the network, but is instead generated on both the client and server side.

## Generating the network map

To be documented.
