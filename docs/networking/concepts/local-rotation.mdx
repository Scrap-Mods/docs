# Local Rotation

Rotation in 3D space can be represented using two vectors. Local rotation is a way to represent the rotation of an object relative to its own axes. This is in contrast to global rotation, which is relative to the world axes.

## Axis representation

The game uses the X axis and the Z axis to represent the local rotation of an object. The Y axis is not used, as it is calculated from the X and Z axes.

The index of the axis is represented by an integer value. The following table shows the mapping between the integer value and the axis:

| Value | Vector (XYZ)   | Axis            |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|
| `-3`  | `( 0,  0, -1)` | Negative Z axis |
| `-2`  | `( 0, -1,  0)` | Negative Y axis |
| `-1`  | `(-1,  0,  0)` | Negative X axis |
| ` 1`  | `( 1,  0,  0)` | Positive X axis |
| ` 2`  | `( 0,  1,  0)` | Positive Y axis |
| ` 3`  | `( 0,  0,  1)` | Positive Z axis |

Any other value is invalid.

Both blueprints and certain network packets use this representation to store the local rotation of an object.

## Default rotation

The default rotation of a shape has an X axis of `(1, 0, 0)` and a Z axis of `(0, 0, 1)`. This means that the X axis of the shape aligns with the X axis of its body, and the Z axis aligns with the Z axis of its body.

Blocks always have the default rotation, while parts and joints can have any local rotation.
