# Format

All data sent over the network is **Little-Endian**.
The only difference is that when compression is enabled, the data is compressed using [LZ4](https://github.com/lz4/lz4).

## Structure

:::tip
When looking for LZ4 compressed blocks in memory - keep an eye out for the `0xF0` byte marking the beginning. It won't always be there but it's really common
