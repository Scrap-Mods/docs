## Structure

| Offset | Field Name           | Field Type      | Notes |
|--------|----------------------|-----------------|-------|
| 0x00   | Local Position High  | [Vec3i](#vec3i) | The position of the positive-x, positive-y, positive-z, exclusive corner of blocks to remove, local to the body. The value of this field is equal to the value of `Local Position Low` plus the size of the box of blocks to remove. Always `(0, 0, 0)` for parts, but the server accepts any value. |
| 0x0C   | Local Position Low   | [Vec3i](#vec3i) | The position of the negative-x, negative-y, negative-z, inclusive corner of blocks to remove, local to the body. Always `(0, 0, 0)` for parts, but the server accepts any value. |
| 0x18   | Removed Surface      | enum [RemovedSurface](#removedsurface-enum) : u8 | The type of surface to remove. |
| 0x19   | Removed Surface Data | ... (8 bytes)   | The data of the removed surface. |

### Vec3i

:::note
The order of the coordinates is Z, Y, X, which may be seen as counterintuitive.

| Offset | Field Name | Field Type | Notes |
|--------|------------|------------|-------|
| 0x00   | Z          | be s32     | The signed Z coordinate. |
| 0x04   | Y          | be s32     | The signed Y coordinate. |
| 0x08   | X          | be s32     | The signed X coordinate. |

### RemovedSurface Enum

This is an exhaustive list. Packets with values not listed in the table do not do anything.

| ID | Removed Surface |
|----|--------|
| 4  | [Body](#removedsurface-4---body) |
| 6  | [Lift](#removedsurface-6---lift) |

:::note
Packet [39 - Remove Joint](./39-remove-joint.mdx) is sent when a joint is removed, not packet 35 - Remove.
