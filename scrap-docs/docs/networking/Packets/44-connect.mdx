# Connect

This packet is sent when the player changes a connection between two connection points with the connect tool.

- **ID**: 0x2C (44)
- **Size**: 9 bytes
- **LZ4 Compressed**: Yes
- **State**: Playing
- **Bound To**: Client -> Server

## Structure

| Offset | Field Name | Field Type  | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------------|-------|
| 0x00   | Child ID   | be u32      | The ID of the interactable or bearing the connection is made to. |
| 0x04   | Parent ID  | be u32      | The ID of the interactable the connection is made from. |
| 0x08   | Flags      | u8 bitfield | The bitfield denoting what type of interaction was made with the connection. See [Flags bitfield](#flags-bitfield). |

#### Interaction type

            <th>Bits</th>
            <th>Field name</th>
            <th>Notes</th>

            <td>Unused</td>
            <td></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>6</td>
            <td>Reverse Direction</td>
            <td>Setting this field reverses the direction the bearing spins in, if it exists.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>5</td>
            <td>Disconnect</td>
            <td>Setting this field destroys the connection between the parent and the child, if it exists.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>4</td>
            <td>Connect</td>
            <td>Setting this field creates a connection between the parent and the child, if it does not exist.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Setting both the `Connect` and the `Disconnect` bits causes the connection to toggle.

If the `Reverse Direction` bit is set, the `Connect` and `Disconnect` bits are ignored. For parts this means the connection cannot be modified if the `Reverse Direction` is set, while for bearings the direction is always reversed, regardless of the values of the `Connect` and `Disconnect` bits.

If no bits are set, nothing happens.

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>Bearing</td>
            <td>Set this bit to connect a part to a bearing.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>0</td>
            <td>Standard</td>
            <td>
                <p>Set this bit to connect two parts or a part to a piston.</p>
                If this bit it set, the <code>Bearing</code> bit is ignored.
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

If no bits are set, nothing happens.

:::warning
If the `Bearing` bit is set, the `Part` bit is not set, and the child of the connection is not a bearing, the game will crash!
:::

## Validation

If either the parent or child do not exist, nothing happens.

If the parent is a scripted part and the child is a bearing, the server does not validate if connecting parent and child is allowed. The connection will be made or destroyed, regardless of the scripted part's `connectionOutput` value.

If the child is a bearing, the server does not validate if the child does not already have a parent. This allows for connecting multiple parents to a single bearing. This can be achieved through blueprint editing as well and is persistent through reloads.
