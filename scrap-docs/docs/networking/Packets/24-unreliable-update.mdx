#### NetObjType 0 - RigidBody

// TODO

#### NetObjType 3 - Controller

| Offset | Field Name      | Field Type | Notes |
|--------|-----------------|------------|-------|
| 0x00   | Interactable ID | be u32     | The ID of the interactable to update. |
| 0x04   | Data            | Variable   | The data of the update. The size and structure depend on the type of the interactable, which is not specified in this update packet. |

#### NetObjType 6 - Character

<BitstreamNotice />

| Offset    | Field Name      | Field Type | Notes |
|-----------|-----------------|------------|-------|
| 0x00 bits | Character ID    | be u32     | The ID of the character to update. |
| 0x20 bits | Is Tumbling     | bool       | Whether or not the character is tumbling. |

##### Not Tumbling

If the `Is Tumbling` field is `False`, the following fields are present:

| Offset    | Field Name      | Field Type      | Notes |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|-------|
| 0x21 bits | Keys            | bitfield [Keys](#keys-bitfield) : u8 | Bitfield of which movement keys are pressed. |
| 0x29 bits | Direction       | u8              | The horizontal direction is moving or last moved in. From a top-down view, a value of `0` indicates the character is moving right. Increasing value of the direction integer rotates the direction counter-clockwise, so a value of `64` indicates forwards, `128` left and `192` backwards. |
| 0x31 bits | Yaw             | u8              | The player's horizontal look rotation. A yaw of `0` means the player is looking into the positive Y direction. Rotating counter-clockwise (to the left) increases the yaw. After reaching `255`, the yaw overflows back to `0`. |
| 0x39 bits | Pitch           | u8              | The player's vertical look rotation. A pitch of `0` means the player is looking straight down (into the negative Z direction). Looking straight up yields a pitch of `128`. |
| 0x41 bits | Position        | [Vec3f](#vec3f) | The world position of the character. |

##### Tumbling

If the `Is Tumbling` field is `True`, the following fields are present:

| Offset    | Field Name       | Field Type      | Notes |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------|-------|
| 0x21 bits | Rotation         | [Quat](#quat)   | The world rotation of the character. |
| 0x41 bits | Position         | [Vec3f](#vec3f) | The world position of the character. |
| 0x59 bits | Velocity         | [Vec3f](#vec3f) | The velocity of the character. |
| 0x71 bits | Angular Velocity | [Vec3f](#vec3f) | The angular velocity of the character. |


### Keys bitfield

:::info
This structure is the same as the Keys bitfield in the [30 - Player Movement](./30-player-movement.mdx#keys-bitfield) packet.
:::

Contains information about which movement keys are pressed. All bits are always low while the player's character is seated.
